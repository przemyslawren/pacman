<h1>Pacman</h1>
<h2>Simple app created for my Java OOP classes</h2>
This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Pacman game, developed as part of OOP coursework. It utilizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern
and leverages the AWT/Swing libraries for its graphical user interface.

Key features include:

Concurrency: The use of threads enables dynamic animations, real-time clock updates, and smooth character movements.
Maze Generation: A depth-first search (DFS) algorithm is employed to generate the game's maze based on specified number of rows and columns.
Unique Approach: An interesting aspect of this project is the foundational use of AbstractTableModel in the game's architecture, showcasing an innovative way to structure and manage game data.
This project shows essential Java programming concepts, including effective use of design patterns, graphical user interfaces, concurrency, and algorithmic problem-solving.
